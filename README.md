- 👋 Hi, I’m @tym83
- 👀 I’m interested in Kotlin, Haskell, Lisp, Rust, Linux, Emacs, Vim and Free Software, but right now I learn only Kotlin and work as chief-editor :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git, Kotlin, SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple free software projects or issues on Kotlin, where I could train and develop my skills for first job.
- 📫 How to reach me — in Telegram t.me/tym83 or 6355522@gmail.com.
